      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm married with two cats, and I'm super excited for this program. I've learned front-end before
        but back-end is a whole other animal. I'm jazzed to learn it and develop new skills.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Colorado Springs, CO.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are crafts, puzzles, and spending time with family & friends.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm not sure what my dream job is yet as far as a job title, but my dream job would be 
        to get to work with my hands to create new things, have a project-based work timeline, 
        and always get to learn or do something new while I'm working. Hence why web development
        could be a perfect fit. :) 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>We recently moved to Fort Collins, CO.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have loved web development since I was a little 12-year-old kid playing with iframes and making pixel art websites.
        This was before Javascript even became popular. I've enjoyed watching all the new technologies come into play, and 
        it's time for me to get back into web development.
